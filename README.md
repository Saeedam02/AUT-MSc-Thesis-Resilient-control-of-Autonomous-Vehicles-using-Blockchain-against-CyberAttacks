# AUT-MSc-Thesis-Resilient-control-of-Autonomous-Vehicles-using-Blockchain-against-Cyber Attacks
A project focused on implementing resilient control mechanisms for autonomous vehicles, using blockchain technology to mitigate cyber-attacks on sensors.

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the MSc project titled **"Resilient Control of Autonomous Vehicles under Cyber-Attacks against Sensors using Blockchain Technology"**. The project aims to develop and implement resilient control mechanisms for autonomous vehicles, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance security against various cyber-attacks on sensor systems.

## Features
- **Resilient Control Algorithms**: Adaptive control systems designed to maintain vehicle stability and performance under cyber-attack conditions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Using blockchain technology to secure communication and data integrity among vehicle sensors and control units.
- **Cyber-Attack Mitigation**: Strategies and mechanisms to detect and counteract various types of cyber-attacks, such as jamming, spoofing, and denial-of-service attacks.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the control algorithms and blockchain integration.
- `docs/`: Documentation and research papers related to the project.
- `simulations/`: Simulation scripts and results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
- `tests/`: Unit tests and test cases for the algorithms and blockchain modules.
